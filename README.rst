General Info
------------

In attempt to analyze the water quality of reservoirs and lakes by remote
sensing methods, such as satellites images, bio-optical models were
used. Those models are mathematical and statistical algorithms which can
be used to predict different water quality indexes by analyzing the
water-leaving radiance measured at different bands of electromagnetic
spectrum by sensors onboard satellites.

According to the literature there are different approaches used in
bio-optical modeling since simple models, based on empirical and
semi-empirical relations, until most complexes models based on radiative
transfer theory.

Currently, this project implements a library of empirical and
semi-empirical models which can be used to predict the concentration of
chlorophyll-a, total suspended solids, water transparency, turbidity,
phycocyanin and the detection of macrophytes in aquatic environments.

All the original equations are adapted in order to be applied in images
collected by MSI (Multispectral Instrument) sensor onboard `Sentinel-2A
and Sentinel-2B
platforms <https://earth.esa.int/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-2-msi>`__.

Getting Started
---------------

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on
your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Technologies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

To execute this project, you’ll need the following technologies:

-  32- or 64-bit computer
-  `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__

Setup
~~~~~

This repository can be used as a complementary library for a main
project and its modules can be used whenever they are necessary.

To install the package and dependencies use the following command:

``pip install qda_modelos``

In order to use **qda_modelos** in your project it's required to install the **rasterio** library:

``pip install rasterio``

You can install dependencies directly in your machine or in a virtual
environment of your choice, such as
`VirtualEnv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`__ or
`Conda <https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/>`__.

Usage
-----

The following example implements the water quality index: turbidity.

The chosen method is ``miller_mckee_2004``\ which expects satellite
images of 659nm wavelength.

This example utilizes Sentinel-2 imagery of which the band 4 has the
central wavelength (665 nm) closest to the models requirement.

-  First, import the required packages and desired methods:

.. code:: python

   import rasterio as rio
   from qda_modelos.total_suspended_solids_turbidity import miller_mckee_2004

In this case, we chose the rasterio package to read and write **.tif**
data files.

-  Set and open the respective satellite images required to analyze the
   indexes:

.. code:: python

   reflectance_659nm_wavelength = rio.open("tests/assets/20m/B4_20m_20181224.tif").read()

-  Open the band image file and choose one or more methods to analyze
   the desired index:

.. code:: python

   meta = rio.open("tests/assets/20m/B4_20m_20181224.tif").meta
   meta.update(driver="GTiff")
   meta.update(dtype=rio.float32)

   miller_mckee_2004 = miller_mckee_2004(reflectance_659nm_wavelength)

-  Create and save the new image generated by the respectives bands of
   the chosen method:

.. code:: python

   with rio.open("miller_mckee_2004.tif", "w", **meta) as dist:
       dist.write(miller_mckee_2004.astype(rio.float32))

-  The output is a **.tif** file containing the processed image by the
   chosen method:
